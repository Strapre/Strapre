              At Strapre, your safety is our priority. While we cannot monitor every interaction between buyers and sellers, we are committed to helping you avoid scams and ensure every deal is a secure one. Here are some essential safety tips to keep in mind during your transactions.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Check Feedback & Ratings</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Before dealing with any seller or service provider, check the "Feedback" section on their profile. Buyers often leave reviews about their experiences — this can give you insight into the seller’s reliability. Your review could also help someone else in the community.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. Avoid Prepayments</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Always opt for <strong>“Pay on Delivery”</strong> where possible. Meet the seller in person, preferably in a public place, inspect the item, and only pay after confirming it meets your expectations.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Confirm the Exact Item Before Payment</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Make sure the packed item is the exact one you inspected. Scammers may try to swap inspected goods with inferior ones — only pay when you have the exact product in your possession.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. Never Share Sensitive Financial Info</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Avoid requests to share your PINs, passwords, or bank login details. Beware of fake payment links or demands for “processing” fees via money transfer services.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. Use Common Sense</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Be cautious of:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                <li>Unrealistically low prices</li>
                <li>Promises of guaranteed jobs, profits, or giveaways</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed italic">
                If it feels too good to be true — it probably is.
